# Isolated Glyph Recognition Pipeline



This project implements a pipeline for isolated glyph recognition. The pipeline is organized into **five main steps**, designed to systematically process and classify individual glyphs with high accuracy.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Data Collection and organization of glyph images.
   - Each image  is annotated and labeled by a subject matter expert.
   - The isolated glyphs are then split into training and test sets.
   - All training and testing sets can be downloaded [here](http://amadi.univ-lr.fr/ICFHR2018_Contest/index.php/download-1234-all)

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Grayscale conversion 
   - Squaring, and padding are applied to standardize the input data for the CNN model
   
3. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Techniques such as rotation, scaling, shearing, and shifting to expand training data.
   - Helps improve model generalization.
   
4. **Classification**  
   - Implementation Transfer Learning and Fine tuning hyperparameters.
   - Trained Ensemble Customized CNN models.
  
5. **Evaluation**  
   - Performance measured using metrics like balanced accuracy, confusion matrix, .
   - Error analysis.
  

Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in isolated glyph classification accuracy. This work lays a solid foundation for optimizing deep learning models in resource-constrained scenarios and contributes to advancing the digitization and preservation of historical documents.
